Comparison to Planned Milestones
================================

The planned milestones from Report 2 differed from reality in that they were
overly aggressive and did not take into account that quickness that Pitfail
team members could implement certain functions. When creating the planned
deadlines in Report 2, team members assumed working two to four hours a day on
Pitfail. What happened is that other responsibilities in other classes resulted
in stretches of inactivity in Pitfail, thus throwing up the planned deadlines.
As the Demo 2 day approached, great amounts of time during the day and night
were put into Pitfail in a way that Microsoft Project could not correctly
capture a "typical Pitfail working day." The result is a History of Work
heavily concentrated around Demo days. If Pitfail were a company, Report 2's
Plan of Work would have been a great guiding factor in agile development.
Instead, Report 3's History of Work better explains how milestones were
achieved. 

The History of Work shows the milestones that were not accomplished as tasks
that are corssed out. The various non-accomplished were not accomplished either
because their predecessors were not accomplished, the milestones were minor
goals if time permitted and time ran out, or the milestones were no longer
deemed necassary: 

1. The support for comlplex actions (orders, derivatives) was not implemented
   because the need for free-form Twitter input seemed unnecessary. The
   structured Twitter input was easily understandable, but without an upgrade
   to an unstructured Twitter input recongizer, advanced actions would not be
   easily understood in the structured Twitter system. Hence, advanced support
   for Twitter was not implemented. 
   
2. Challeges was not implemented because the teams and leagues were delievered
   very close to Demo 2. Implemented challenges would have been a trade-off
   between itself and debugging and debugging was deemed more important. 
   
3. Implemented OpenID for Facebook and Google was deemed not necassary since
   Twitter offered a similar service that was already implemented.
