1. The domain model has been massively expanded to reflect the domain-specific
   aspects of PitFail. This is described in `How the Domain Model Has Changed`_

2. The interaction diagrams have also reached further into the domain-specific
   areas of PitFail, to cover the new domain concepts. See `Perturbations and
   Interactions`_. Note that these are for the most part not changes in the
   actual software, just changes in how we understand the role of the
   documentation.

3. PitFail has largely stuck to its original requirements; however, many more
   of those requirements have been implemented than had been at the time of
   report#2. Requirements that have been implemented since then:
   
   #. The addition of leagues.
   
   #. The addition of Teams (portfolios with multiple owners).
   
   #. The ability to view a portfolio's history
   
   #. It is possible to sell only part of your holdings of a stock via the website.
      
   #. The ability to view league standings.
   
   #. The ability to comment on trades.
   
   #. The ability to vote on trades.
   
   #. The ability to receive notifications about stocks one cares about via the android client.
   
   #. The ability to receive an email newsletter about one's portfolio.
   
   #. Dividends are now paid to users' portfolios (This is important. See dividendmotive_).
   
   #. The ability to trade stocks directly with other players.
   
   #. The ability to place limit orders.
   
   #. Trading of stocks is now limited to available traders (which is far more realistic).
   
   #. Execution of market orders is now more realistic -- orders are executed at the asking
      price, not the last traded price.
